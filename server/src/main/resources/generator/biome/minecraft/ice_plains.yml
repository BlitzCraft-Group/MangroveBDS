    # porktodo: this, along with some other things (like snow layers) is a bit messy because of the fact that when something from a neighboring chunk
    # overhangs onto this biome after this biome was populated, it'll result in the overhang being OVER the ice layer, even though the entire purpose
    # of it being applied last is to avoid exactly that. i'm not sure how vanilla avoids this (it should have the same problem...), only thing i can
    # think of is a third "post-population" phase (but that's bad for other reasons)
